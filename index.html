 <h2>Sheniqua Johnson</h2>
 <p>Hello, I'm Sheniqua Johnson, and adventure runs in my blood! Whether it's soaring through the 
    treetops on a thrilling zipline, tearing up the trails on an ATV, or simply cherishing moments 
    with my loved ones, I live for excitement and connection. My passion lies in exploration, from 
    savoring exotic cuisines to getting lost in the rhythms of different dances. Life is a grand 
    adventure, and I'm here to embrace every moment of it with open arms!I am drawn to web development 
    because it offers me the opportunity to build and bring websites to life. The thought of coding and 
    designing, transforming lines of text into functional, beautiful websites, truly inspires me. It's 
    a field where I can continuously learn and adapt, and I'm eager to be a part of shaping the online world.</p>
